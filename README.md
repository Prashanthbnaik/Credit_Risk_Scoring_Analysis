# Credit Risk Scoring Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes loan application and borrower behavior data from LendingClub to build a credit risk scoring system. By leveraging Power BI, Power Query, and SQL on a dataset of over 1.4 million rows, the goal is to help lenders assess applicant risk levels and make informed approval decisions.
