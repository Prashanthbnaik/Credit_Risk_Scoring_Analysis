# Credit Risk Scoring Analysis

## Overview
This project explores loan and borrower behavior data from LendingClub to build a credit risk scoring model. Using SQL, Power BI, and Power Query on a dataset of over 2 million records, we uncover key insights to help lenders assess applicant risk and optimize approval decisions.
